Java Instrumentation Engineer,"Portland, Oregon",Full Time,"<p>New Relic
Java Instrumentation Engineer
Portland, OR</p>

<p>Think of a tool that makes your job so much better that you want to tell everyone about it. It might be your IDE, a mobile app, a web framework, a profiler, or an API. Now imagine that you help to build that tool with a smart, dedicated, and collaborative team.</p>

<p>New Relic is looking for a software engineer to join our world-class Java Agent team. The Java Agent team ensures that New Relic provide the best possible experience for customers building apps on the JVM.</p>

<p>You are a developer who has built sophisticated web applications and/or Java tooling in a fast-paced agile environment. You keep an eye on industry trends and love to apply compelling new technologies. You are experienced in performance optimization and monitoring because you take pride in having a system that runs quickly and smoothly.</p>

<p>Working on an agent at New Relic means working with some of the brightest software engineers in the industry. In our polyglot environment, you regularly share insights with engineers working in Ruby, PHP, C, Python, .NET, and Javascript. You may find yourself comparing implementation notes with an expert Python developer one day and pair programming with Ward Cunningham the next. By working across different technologies, work at New Relic borrows the best from many communities.</p>

<p>We’re a very fast growing pre-IPO start-up and we care about our culture. We value respect, engineer code ownership, and experimentation.</p>

<p>To fast track your cover letter please tell us about a time you introduced positive change to your team, and why you want to join our fun dynamic company.</p>

More important than all of that: we provide challenging work, opportunities to learn, high quality teammates, a standard-setting product, and a company on the move.</p>

<p>Our office is in the tech mecca of Portland, with easy commute access and a plethora of good eats and great coffee. We provide competitive compensation, stock options and big-company benefits (medical, dental, etc.)— all while maintaining the energy, agility, and fun of a start-up.

"Engineering Manager, Business Applications","San Francisco, California",Full Time,"<p>New Relic
Engineering Manager, Business Applications
San Francisco, CA</p>

<p>Are you the ace engineering manager who will run part of our fast-growing Business Applications engineering team? </p>

<p>You really do need to be an ace for this. Our engineers are particularly smart, creative, hard-working, and capable collaborators. They need leadership, not supervision. Management at NR leads by example. Managers here help engineers ship great features by providing resources, eliminating blockers, and keeping folks informed. If you&#39;re a command-and-control person, this is not the right place for you. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been a software engineer yourself, and you love helping other engineers excel and manage projects working with engineers and business users, we might be the perfect place.</p>

<p>Management here is serious business. We have the best management-mentoring program in any start-up -- perhaps the best, period. It is hard work. Your job as an engineering manager is to pave the way for engineers to do great things and lead projects across organizations. That could mean sitting in meetings so that engineers don&#39;t have to; it could mean working with other leaders to keep focus and without repeated changes helping engineers to stay focus and deliver; it could mean coaching an engineer all night through their first big conference presentation. It means whatever it takes to help our engineers ship great features, constantly level up--and have fun doing it! (Of course, you&#39;ll have fun too.)</p>

<p>Our Business Applications team is different than most engineering groups. We own all of New Relic&#39;s internal business applications -- behind-the-scenes essential infrastructure needed for finance, sales, marketing, and business development. To lead on our team, you need to be able to connect easily and communicate fluently with both geeky engineers and friendly business people. You must get the agile and SaaS lifecycle; incremental delivery; continuous deployment; and everything about &quot;Lean Startup&quot;. </p>

<p>You&#39;re someone who acts with drive and urgency, yet always takes the time to listen and to do the right thing. You are constantly seeking new ways to explain, coach, teach, and bring out the best in others. You are willing and able to take bold decisions to move fast and experiments, you are one who quickly learn from your and others mistakes.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be a serious candidate if you have 2+ years of experience with various &quot;new-age&quot; development tools and languages as a sharp engineer, a track record of delivering socially complex projects (must be able to demonstrate or it&#39;s a &quot;no go&quot;), and 2 years or more serving in a management or lead role. Experience of delivering Sales and Marketing business applications and processes enabled by technology is required. </p>

<p>Tell us about your management philosophy in your cover letter and give examples of your risk-reward thinking with releases. And, of course, we want to hear why you might be particularly interested in New Relic. </p>

<p>A little about us:</p>

<p>Their ideal environment is driven by rapid prototyping concepts and they have a demonstrated record of using creativity and innovation to go beyond current tools to deliver the best solution to complex problems.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity to innovate and have a direct impact on our future product line.  It is a high-visibility role in an environment where the Founder/CEO actively participates in the creation and development of our product suite.</p>

More important than all of that: we provide challenging work, opportunities to learn, high quality teammates, a standard-setting product, and a company on the move.</p>

<p>Our office is in the tech-rich urban center of San Francisco, with easy commute access and a plethora of good eats. We provide competitive compensation, stock options, and big-company benefits (medical, dental, etc) -- all while maintaining the energy, agility, and fun of a start-up.
